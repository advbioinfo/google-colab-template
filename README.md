# [Bioinformatics 1] Cryodrgn 

CryoDRGN is a Cryo-EM neural network-based method for heterogeneous reconstruction. Conventional methods for dealing heterogeneity uses descrete K means clustering. Instead, CryoDRGN learns a generative model for heterogeneous reconstruction giving a continuous distribution of density maps parameterized by a coordinate-based neural network.
